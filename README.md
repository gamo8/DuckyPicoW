Wifi Password Grabber with Raspberry Pico W (No Internet Needed)

This project is only for educational purposes. This kind of attack was shown in Mr. Robot's show.

Also, there were many attacks tentative using social engineering techniques like sending Bad USBs to US goverment employees impersonating companies like Netflix.

A nice video showing the attack can be found here:

When Raspberry Pi Pico W is connected via USB to a Windows computer, it will grab the wifi passwords stored in the computer and instantly create a Wifi AP (Access Point) and publish this information via web server.

Here is what I was able to do
